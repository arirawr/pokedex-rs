This is primarily a practice project for learning about Rust and Cargo.
You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AriVanider) for stuff about community and Rust and game dev.

If you _really_ want to use this tool, here's how:

1. `cargo install pokedex -f`

#### Known Issues

- If you spell the Pokemon's name wrong, you'll get a bad error.
- Gen 8 Pokemon (Sword and Shield) are not yet included as they aren't supported by veekun/pokedex and the PokeAPI yet. [Tracking issue here](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex/issues/284).
